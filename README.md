### UNIT Factory project: online shop with: filters, basket, admin section, user account.

This is my first web project:
  - procedural;
  - MySQL DB usage;
  - code is not very clean and strucured, as it is my first implementation of HTML+JS+PHP+MySQL stack

In file connect_func.php configure connection:
 - servarname
 - username
 - password
 
The DB name must be 'main'.

For admin section - log in with <br/>
login: admin <br/>
password: admin <br/>
